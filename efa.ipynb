    "Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a statistical method used to describe latent factors by associating certain variables together. Latent factors are factors that are not directly measureable, such as solidarity and power, but that affect the outcome of measured variables. It is helpful to perform EFA on matched guise data, which often contains 10+ feature sets, in order to make the data more interpretable and to reduce the number of variables for future analysis (i.e. regression models).

    "Exploratory factor analysis is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction (reduces the number of features in a data set) and for solving issues of colinearity among variables. The technique aims to find correlations of variance among variables to pinpoint the underlying structure of the data set, effectively identifying latent factors that cannot be measured directly, but that affect a set of variables. Importantly, these latent factors are *interpretable*, and can be labeled (contrary to components identified by principal component analysis). The image below illustrates this distinction.\n",

    "The process of factor analysis begins with the generation of a correlation matrix across each variable in the data set. Then, factor loadings are calculated by various methods, to approximate the original correlation matrix using fewer variables. A very common method of calculating factor loadings is the method of least squares (or minimum residuals), which aims to minimize the sum of squares in the loadings matrix. Once the loadings matrix is generaed, the coordinates of factor dimensions are rotated to increase the interpretability of the factors.\n",

    "- `method`; the extraction method determines the statistical method that generates factors before rotation; the default method is `minres` which uses a minimum residual solution, other options include `ml`, maximal liklihood, and `principal`, principal components.\n",
    "- `rotation`; rotation changes the coordinates of the factor dimensions, thereby increasing the interpretability of the factors (each variable is associated with a maximum of one factor). `varimax` is a commonly selected rotation method as it maintains an orthogonal relationship between factors (not correlated). Another option is `promax`, which allows factors to be correlated, and is the default setting.\n",
