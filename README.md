# machine_learning_for_linguistics
This repository contains tutorials for some statistical and machine learning techniques in Python, with applications in linguistic research. 

If you do not already have a way to access JupyterLab on your computer, you can visit <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> to download Anaconda Navigator, which will give you access to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook.

Alternatively, if you are affiliated with UC Berkeley, you can access JupyterLab through datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/login.

## Notebooks:
- `k_means.ipynb` provides a tutorial of k-means clustering;
- `efa.ipynb` provides a tutorial of exploratory factor analysis (EFA).

## Data:
- `blp_scores.csv` is a sample dataset that is used to demonstrate the utility of k-means clustering;
- `matched_guise.csv` is a sample dataset that is used to demonstrate the utility of EFA.

## Figures:
- `efa_process.png` is a figure showing the process of EFA (taken from Gaskin 2014 - Exploratory Factor Analysis (conceptual). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2JBLuQDUvI);
- `efa_table.png` is a sample table that shows how factor analysis for matched guise data could be reported in a paper.
